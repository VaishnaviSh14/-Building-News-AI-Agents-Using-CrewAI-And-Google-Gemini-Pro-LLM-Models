> 🚀 **Automated News Research & Writing** using multi-agent AI, CrewAI framework, and Google Gemini LLM.

---

## 📌 Overview
This project builds an **AI-powered News Research & Writing System** using **CrewAI** and **Google Gemini Pro (1.5 Flash)** LLM models.  
It features two autonomous agents – a **Senior Researcher** and a **Writer** – who collaborate to research trending topics, analyze insights, and generate well-structured news blog posts.  
The system uses **Serper API** for real-time web search and outputs ready-to-publish content.

## 🏗️ Project Structure
```bash
📂 News-AI-Agents
 ├── agents.py            # Defines Researcher & Writer agents
 ├── crew.py              # Creates Crew & orchestrates workflow
 ├── tasks.py             # Defines tasks for research & writing
 ├── tools.py             # Initializes Serper API search tool
 ├── .env                 # Stores API keys (Google & Serper)
 └── news_blog_post.txt   # Output blog file (generated)

## 📝 Example Output

### **The AI Revolution in Healthcare: Generative AI Takes Center Stage**

Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming the healthcare landscape, and the latest wave of innovation is driven by generative AI. This powerful technology is poised to revolutionize drug discovery, personalize medicine, and enhance patient care in unprecedented ways.

**What is Generative AI in Healthcare?**

Unlike traditional AI, which primarily analyzes existing data, generative AI models create new data.  In healthcare, this translates to the ability to generate novel molecular structures for drug candidates, predict drug efficacy with greater accuracy, and tailor treatment plans to individual patients based on their unique genetic makeup, lifestyle, and medical history.

**The Promise of Generative AI:**

* **Accelerated Drug Discovery:** Shortens drug development timelines by generating and testing candidates quickly.
* **Personalized Medicine:** Builds treatment plans based on patient-specific data.
* **Improved Diagnostics:** Enhances medical imaging and early detection.
* **Enhanced Drug Efficacy:** Prioritizes promising drugs to reduce wasted resources.

**Challenges and Ethical Considerations:**

* **Data Bias** – Must ensure fairness and accuracy.
* **Privacy & Security** – Protect sensitive patient data.
* **Explainability** – Build transparent and trustworthy AI models.
* **Regulations** – Evolving frameworks may slow adoption.

**Key Players & Future Directions:**
Pharma giants, biotech startups, and research institutions are leading innovation. Future trends include multi-omics data integration, better model explainability, and stronger regulatory clarity.

### ✅ Architecture Diagram  
I can generate a **clean PNG/SVG diagram** for you that looks like this:

**Agents & Tasks Workflow (Visual):**  

```

\[Input Topic] → \[News Researcher 🔍] → \[Research Report 📑] → \[News Writer ✍️] → \[News Blog Post 📰]

```

Would you like me to **generate a visually appealing PNG/SVG diagram** (with icons, colors, arrows, and a professional layout) that you can directly upload to your `assets/` folder and link in your README?  
This will make the README look **much more professional** on GitHub.
```
